steps for adding remote git repo
1. created a repo in git
2. open local folder path in cmd and do --> git init
3. then add remote git repo --> git remote add origin url-of-git-repo
4. then create a branch and checkout to that branch --> git checkout -b branch-name
5. "git status" to see changed files
6. "git add ." to add changed files
7. git commit -m"commit message" for commiting by giving relevante message
8. "git push origin branch-name"

instead of adding remote git repo we can directly clone that remote git repo file by

9. "git clone repo-url"

create branch from another brach
10. "git checkout -b myFeature dev"  // creating myFeature branch from dev branch

to merge changes your changes to dev (ff) fastforward
11. checkout dev branch "git checkout dev" and then "git merge --no-ff myFeature"

to push changes to serve
12. "git push origin dev"

to take pull from parent branch  // taking pull from dev branch in myFeature branch
13. first checkout the pull 
   "git checkout myFeature" and take pull "git pull origin dev"

to rebase from dev branch to feature branch
14. checkout to feature branch and then rebase "git rebase dev"
