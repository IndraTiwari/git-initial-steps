steps for adding remote git repo
1. created a repo in git
2. open local folder path in cmd and do --> git init
3. then add remote git repo --> git remote add origin url-of-git-repo
4. then create a branch and checkout to that branch --> git checkout -b branch-name
5. "git status" to see changed files
6. "git add ." to add changed files
7. git commit -m"commit message" for commiting by giving relevante message
8. "git push origin branch-name"

instead of adding remote git repo we can directly clone that remote git repo file by

9. "git clone repo-url"

create branch from another brach
10. "git checkout -b myFeature dev"  // creating myFeature branch from dev branch

to merge changes your changes to dev
11. checkout dev branch "git checkout dev" and then "git merge --no-ff myFeature"

to push changes to serve
12. "git push origin dev"

to take pull from parent branch  // taking pull from dev branch in myFeature branch
13. first checkout the pull 
   "git checkout myFeature" and take pull "git pull origin dev"
